# ChatBot

*A lab report by Alana C. Student*

## Make the ChatBot your own

The 'textbot' has a brief conversation with the user and determines whether or not they should send a text message.  The four main cases are based on whether the user is on good terms with the recipient and whether the user is drunk.
