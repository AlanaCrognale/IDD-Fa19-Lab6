# ChatBot

*A lab report by John Q. Student*

## In this Report

To submit your lab, fork [this repository](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/IDD-Fa18-Lab6). You'll need to upload any code you change into your fork, as well as upload a video of a friend or classmate using your chatbot.

## Make the ChatBot your own

The 'textbot' has a brief conversation with the user and determines whether or not they should send a text message.  The four main cases are based on whether the user is on good terms with the recipient and whether the user is drunk.
